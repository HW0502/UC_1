                <p>For ribs, wash the bones in running water to remove impurities. Soak in water for 30 minutes, drain the blood, remove moisture with a kitchen towel, and then put the sheath with the tip of a knife.<br><em>tip!</em> If you immerse in coke for 10 minutes instead of water in the process of draining the blood, the meat will be soft and juicy.</p>
